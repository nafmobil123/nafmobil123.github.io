              The tracks are covered in rust and the white colors of the walls are hidden behind the sea of graffiti.
              Whether its 3 a.m or 3 p.m, we are never alone or lonely here.
              From the moment the door slides open, the platform transforms into a sea of faces, whose waves are continuous and rear up before crashing down onto the staircase.
              Everyone walks shoulder to shoulder, in each other's faces with no sense of personal space.
              Every neck is a stream of sweat that's never-ending, Bending down to pick something up impossible and take your phone out at your own risk or else it might get swallowed by the wave.
              It's an unsaid rule of this city that's injected into your blood the moment you take your first steps here that you must never stop.
              You don't stop in your tracks, and the people in the crowd are just in your way.

            You walk by strangers every day here, but you aren't supposed to ask them how they are.
            You see someone with tears streaming down their face, and you look the other way.
            You see someone with a bruised face or knuckles, and you turn your gaze back to your phone.
            You see someone with a bloody lip and clothes that are ripped beyond wear, and you avert your stare and look past them as if they don't even exist.
            Everyone is everywhere.
            We are all busy dreaming about the next day.
            We are hungry monsters who are waiting to burst out of the cage and that flimsy rectangular shaped card is our key way out of here.</p></td>
